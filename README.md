# myFlix Client Side Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I created this app to become more familiar with React.js.
The APP relies on an API that was built with node.js and Express serving a database built with MongoDB, which is hosted on Heroku.
React-Bootstrap was used for the basic navigation and styling. 
Components include: 
<ul>
<li>LogIn View</li>
<li>Registration View</li>
<li>Main View</li>
<li>Movie Card</li>
<li>Director View</li>
<li>Movie Synopsis View</li>
<li>....and others</li>
</ul>
Routing was acheived by using HashRouter from react-router-dom.

State is managed with REDUX as well as local State management. 

This was a great project to learn passing props as well as building class and functional components. 

axios handles API calls flawlessly.

Users can add and remove favorites with fun heart icons; and even update their user registration info.
